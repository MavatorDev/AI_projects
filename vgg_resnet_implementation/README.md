 This report focuses on two
 of the best known CNN architectures: VGG and ResNet.
 A comparative analysis of these models is performed,
 evaluating their performance on image classification
 tasks using, particularly, the MNIST dataset. The mod
els are evaluated based on accuracy, training dynamics,
 and their generalization capabilities. There is also an
 exploration of possible improvements to these models
 by modifying their training strategies, their architec
ture, and data modifications. Finally, adaptations to
 both models are implemented to specifically enhance
 execution time. This study aims to provide a deeper
 understanding of the strengths and limitations of VGG
 and ResNet to ultimately contribute to more efficient
 and effective strategies for image classification.
